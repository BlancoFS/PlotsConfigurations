# Template configuration files

Last update: 13/11/2019

`samples.py` and `nuisances.py` template files for different years. These include all standard sample and uncertainties used in HWW legacy analysis.

Don't use these templates out of the box, but just as a starting point! Different channels may need different samples/nuisances, so check them carefully!
